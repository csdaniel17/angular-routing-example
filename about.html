<h2>about us</h2>

<p>
  Wonderful Days Preschool, Inc. (WDP) is a Georgia non-profit 501(c)(3) Preschool program for at-risk families that meet Federal Income Eligibility Guidelines in the Cobb County area. It is a private, tuition- free preschool that serves two meals a day and provides free transportation.

  WDP's program objective is to provide an outstanding experience that prepares children with the early educational skills they need to succeed in Kindergarten and beyond in our public school system. We use Scholastic's "Big Day for Pre-K", a bilingual, literacy-based curriculum, which includes daily lessons on vocabulary, language, math, emergent reading, and emergent writing skills. The student ration is 8:1 in our pre-Kindergarten/4's classes and 6:1 in our preschool/3's classes.
